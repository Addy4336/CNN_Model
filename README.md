# CNN Image Classification Project

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. It demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a deep learning model on an image dataset for digit classification using Python.

## Project Overview

The project explores image classification to recognize digits using a CNN. Key components include:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- CNN architecture setup
- Model training and evaluation
  
## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow` or `keras` (depending on the framework used in this project)
  
You can install these dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow
